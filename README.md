# How to run

1. For automated trading, run the following command:  
        >   `python run.py`    
There are some default command-line arguments (see the run.py script for details). For example, the above command is basically same as,  
        >   `python run.py -e 1000 -i 10000 -s MSFT AMZN IBM`  
You can input any number of episodes, amount of initial investment and stocks you want by following the above sequence in the         command-line. For example,  
        >   `python run.py -e 2000 -s NVDA INTC`
        
2. To generate plots for the stock data, run the following command.      
        >   `python run_stock_data.py`  
which is by default same as,  
        >   `python run_stock_data.py -s MSFT AMZN IBM`   
But you can input any stocks you want instead of MSFT, AMZN or IBM. For example,      
        >   `python run_stock_data.py -s TSLA AAPL`
